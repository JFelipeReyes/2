## ABSTRACT
The line follower robot is a device created for the purpose of researchand exploration of electronics, with emphasis on robotics. The project in its final stage should be able to follow the orders proposed in the development of this laboratory. This is a fully simulated laboratory, therefore, there is no practical component, but it is the basis to execute the practice and ensure its operation.

## INTRODUCTION
In the electronic, one of the most important and interesting areas is the robotic, not only because today it has an application in almost every field, but also because it allows the creation of an unlimited number of models as well as an unlimited number of practical applications. It can be used at home, at school, in industry, in commerce, in research, in short, in all fields of knowledge and human endeavor can fit an application of robotics. Moreover, in our case, it allows us to approach programming and the practical application of the knowledge obtained theoretically in class.

## THEORETIC MARK
For the successful development of this laboratory, all the guidelines exposed during digital electronics II must be considered; among these are: truth tables, Karnaugh maps, use of logic gates, design of flowcharts and later programming in assembler code. It should be noted that we must have previous knowledge on the handling of circuit simulation software such as Proteus.

## ANALYSIS OF RESULTS

In this section of the laboratory, we will see the development of the methods used to carry out the simulation of the line follower robot:
We will start with the truth table:
